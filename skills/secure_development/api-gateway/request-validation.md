# Request Validation at the API Gateway

## Security Requirement

API gateways SHOULD validate incoming requests and filter malformed ones before dispatching them to downstream components. This prevents specially crafted requests from exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems behind the gateway.

## Components Protected

By filtering at the gateway, the following downstream components are shielded from malformed input:

- Guardrails component
- Prompt orchestrator
- Inference engine
- Models themselves

## Validation Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Schema validation** | Validate request body against the expected API schema (e.g., OpenAPI spec) |
| **Content-Type enforcement** | Reject requests with unexpected or missing Content-Type headers |
| **Payload size limits** | Enforce maximum request body size to prevent resource exhaustion |
| **Character encoding validation** | Ensure proper encoding, reject unexpected encodings |
| **Header validation** | Validate required headers are present and well-formed |
| **Path traversal prevention** | Block requests with path traversal patterns |
| **Input length limits** | Enforce maximum prompt length / token count at the gateway |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define and enforce API schema validation (OpenAPI or equivalent)
- [ ] Set maximum payload size limits appropriate for the model input
- [ ] Validate Content-Type headers on all requests
- [ ] Enforce character encoding standards (UTF-8)
- [ ] Block requests with path traversal patterns or injection attempts
- [ ] Set maximum prompt/input length limits
- [ ] Log rejected requests with reason for security monitoring
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP error codes (400, 413, 415) for validation failures
