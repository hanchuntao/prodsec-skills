# Short-Lived JWT Token Enforcement for Inference Engines

## Security Requirement

Inference engines MUST enforce short-lived JWT access tokens with a maximum TTL of 15 minutes. Tokens MUST be validated against the IdP's JWKS endpoint on every request.

## Required JWT Claims Validation

Every request to the inference engine must include a JWT with the following validated claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://your-idp.com",
  "aud": "https://your-engine.com/inference.api",
  "scope": "chat:read inference:write",
  "sub": "user|service-id",
  "exp": "now+15min (maximum)",
  "jti": "unique_id_for_revocation",
  "cnf": "x509-thumbprint"
}
```

## Claim Validation Rules

| Claim | Validation Rule |
|---|---|
| `iss` | MUST match the configured external IdP issuer URL exactly |
| `aud` | MUST match the inference engine's audience identifier |
| `scope` | MUST contain the required scopes for the requested operation |
| `sub` | MUST identify the user or service account making the request |
| `exp` | MUST be present and no more than 15 minutes from `iat` |
| `jti` | MUST be unique; check against revocation blacklist |
| `cnf` | If mTLS is used, MUST match the client certificate thumbprint (sender-constrained token) |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Validate JWT signature against IdP JWKS on every request
- [ ] Reject tokens with `exp` exceeding 15 minutes from issuance
- [ ] Verify `iss` matches the trusted IdP
- [ ] Verify `aud` matches the engine's identifier
- [ ] Check `jti` against revocation blacklist (Redis or local cache)
- [ ] Validate `scope` contains permissions required for the operation
- [ ] If mTLS enabled, verify `cnf` claim matches client certificate
- [ ] Reject tokens missing any required claims
