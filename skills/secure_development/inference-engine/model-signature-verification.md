# Model Signature Verification in Inference Engines

## Security Recommendation

Before the inference engine loads and serves a model, it SHOULD verify the model's integrity by checking its cryptographic signature. This ensures the model has not been tampered with and comes from a trusted source.

## What Signature Verification Provides

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Integrity** | Confirms the model files have not been modified since signing |
| **Provenance** | Confirms the model was published by a trusted entity |
| **Tamper detection** | Detects unauthorized modifications to model weights or configuration |
| **Supply chain security** | Protects against compromised model distribution channels |

## Verification Flow

```
1. Model is signed by the publisher using a private key
2. Signature and public key/certificate are distributed alongside the model
3. Before loading, inference engine:
   a. Retrieves the model's signature
   b. Retrieves the trusted public key or certificate
   c. Verifies the signature against the model files
   d. If verification fails: REFUSE to load the model and log a security event
   e. If verification succeeds: proceed to load
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement signature verification in the model loading pipeline
- [ ] Maintain a list of trusted signing keys or certificates
- [ ] Refuse to load models with invalid or missing signatures
- [ ] Log signature verification results (success and failure) as security events
- [ ] Support standard signing formats (e.g., Sigstore/cosign, GPG)
- [ ] Verify signatures on every model load, not just first download
- [ ] Alert security team on signature verification failures
