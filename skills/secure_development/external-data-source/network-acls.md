# Network ACLs for External Data Sources

## Security Recommendation

If access to external data sources will come from specific known sources, network ACLs SHOULD be implemented to allow access only from those known sources. This provides a network-level defense-in-depth layer on top of authentication and authorization.

## Defense-in-Depth Value

Network ACLs complement authentication and authorization by restricting **which network locations** can even attempt to connect:

```
Network ACLs (can this source IP/network connect at all?)
  → Authentication (is this principal who they claim to be?)
    → Authorization (does this principal have permission?)
      → Data access (execute the query/operation)
```

Even if credentials are compromised, network ACLs prevent their use from unauthorized network locations.

## ACL Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| **IP allowlist** | Allow connections only from specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges |
| **Security groups** | Cloud-native network rules scoped to specific resources |
| **Network policies** | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy restricting pod-to-pod and egress traffic |
| **Service mesh** | Istio/Envoy authorization policies based on workload identity |
| **Firewall rules** | Traditional firewall rules at the network perimeter |

## Network Encryption and Exposure

- It should be possible to encrypt **all** network communications, both internal and external
- For cloud services, all network communications (internal and external) **must** be encrypted
- Endpoints that do not need to be exposed to the Internet must not be public-facing
- All TCP and UDP ports that are not required must be **closed by default**

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify all AI system components that need to access each external data source
- [ ] Document the source IP ranges or network identities for each component
- [ ] Configure network ACLs on the data source to allow only those known sources
- [ ] Default to deny-all, then explicitly allow required connections
- [ ] Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicy if running in Kubernetes
- [ ] Use cloud security groups if running in cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Regularly audit network ACLs and remove stale entries
- [ ] Monitor for connection attempts from unauthorized sources
- [ ] All network communications are encrypted (TLS) or encryption is configurable
- [ ] Non-Internet-facing endpoints are not publicly exposed
- [ ] Unused TCP/UDP ports are closed by default
