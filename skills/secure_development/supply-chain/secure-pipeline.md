# Secure CI/CD Pipeline

## Security Requirement

CI/CD pipelines for AI software MUST implement security scanning to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## Required Scanning Types

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Analyze source code for security vulnerabilities without executing it:

| What SAST Catches | Examples |
|---|---|
| Injection vulnerabilities | SQL injection, command injection, XSS |
| Hardcoded secrets | API keys, passwords in source code |
| Insecure configurations | Weak crypto, disabled TLS verification |
| Code quality issues | Buffer overflows, null dereferences |

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

Analyze third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

| What SCA Catches | Examples |
|---|---|
| Known CVEs | Vulnerabilities in libraries and frameworks |
| License compliance | Incompatible or problematic licenses |
| Outdated dependencies | Libraries with available security patches |
| Transitive vulnerabilities | Vulnerabilities in dependencies of dependencies |

## Pipeline Integration

```
Source code commit
  → SAST scan (analyze source code)
  → SCA scan (analyze dependencies)
  → Unit tests
  → Build artifacts
  → Container image scan
  → Sign artifacts
  → Generate SBOM
  → Deploy (if all checks pass)
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Integrate SAST scanning into the CI/CD pipeline (run on every PR/commit)
- [ ] Integrate SCA scanning into the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Fail the build on high/critical severity findings
- [ ] Scan container images for vulnerabilities before pushing to registry
- [ ] Configure alerts for newly discovered CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] Review and triage SAST/SCA findings regularly
- [ ] Maintain suppression/allowlists for accepted risks (documented and time-limited)
