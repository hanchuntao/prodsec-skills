# LLM File Protection

## Security Requirement

Large Language Models are composed of files (weights, configuration, tokenizer, etc.) loaded by the inference engine. These files MUST be protected against unauthorized access and modification.

## Risks of Unprotected Model Files

| Risk | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Unauthorized access** | Model theft, intellectual property loss |
| **Unauthorized modification** | Backdoored or poisoned model served to users |
| **Tampering** | Modified weights producing biased, harmful, or incorrect outputs |
| **Data extraction** | Extracting sensitive training data embedded in model weights |

## Required Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Access control** | Only authorized users and services can read model files |
| **Write protection** | Only authorized pipelines can modify model files |
| **Integrity verification** | Detect unauthorized modifications via checksums or signatures |
| **Encryption at rest** | Encrypt model files on disk to protect against storage-level access |
| **Audit logging** | Log all access to model files |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Store model files in access-controlled storage (not world-readable)
- [ ] Grant read access only to the inference engine service account
- [ ] Grant write access only to authorized model deployment pipelines
- [ ] Mount model files as read-only in the inference engine container
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest for model storage volumes
- [ ] Implement integrity checks (checksums or signatures) verified at load time
- [ ] Log all access to model files for audit
- [ ] Regularly audit file permissions and access patterns
