# Secure Storage for Model Registries

## Security Requirement

Only authenticated and authorized users MUST be able to access the storage where models are stored. Unauthorized access to model storage can lead to model theft, tampering, or injection of malicious models.

## Required Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | All access to storage requires authenticated identity |
| **Authorization** | RBAC controls over read, write, and delete operations |
| **Encryption at rest** | Model files encrypted on the storage backend |
| **Access logging** | All storage access operations logged |
| **Network isolation** | Storage accessible only from authorized networks/services |

## Access Control Matrix

| Role | Read Models | Write/Upload | Delete | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inference engine (service) | Yes | No | No | No |
| ML engineer | Yes | Yes (with approval) | No | No |
| Model pipeline (CI/CD) | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Registry admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Unauthorized | No | No | No | No |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Require authentication for all access to model storage
- [ ] Implement RBAC with least-privilege roles for storage operations
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest on the storage backend
- [ ] Restrict network access to storage (internal only, use network policies)
- [ ] Log all storage access operations for audit
- [ ] Regularly audit storage access permissions
- [ ] Disable anonymous or public access to model storage
