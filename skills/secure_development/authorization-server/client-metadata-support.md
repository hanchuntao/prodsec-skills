# OAuth Client ID Metadata Document Support in Authorization Servers

## Security Recommendation

Authorization servers SHOULD support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents. This mechanism allows clients (including MCP clients) to present their identity and configuration without requiring pre-registration, by hosting a metadata document at their `client_id` URL.

## How It Works

1. Client presents a `client_id` that is an HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://mcp-client.example.com/client-metadata`)
2. Authorization server fetches the metadata document from that URL
3. Authorization server validates the client's configuration from the document
4. Authorization server uses the metadata for the OAuth flow

## Validation Rules

When fetching and processing client metadata documents, the authorization server MUST:

| Rule | Details |
|---|---|
| Fetch over HTTPS | Only retrieve metadata from HTTPS URLs |
| Verify `client_id` match | The `client_id` in the document must match the URL it was fetched from |
| Validate `redirect_uris` | Ensure redirect URIs are valid and use HTTPS |
| Check grant types | Only allow grant types the server supports |
| Apply security policies | Enforce server-side policies on client configurations |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Accept `client_id` values that are HTTPS URLs
- [ ] Fetch client metadata documents from the `client_id` URL
- [ ] Validate the `client_id` field in the document matches the fetch URL
- [ ] Validate `redirect_uris` for security (HTTPS, no wildcards)
- [ ] Apply rate limiting on metadata document fetches
- [ ] Cache fetched metadata with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Reject metadata documents that fail validation
- [ ] Log client metadata fetch attempts for audit
