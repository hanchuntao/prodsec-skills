# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for MCP Servers

## Security Recommendation

MCP servers SHOULD implement RBAC as a defense-in-depth layer by mapping token claims to internal application roles. This adds authorization beyond what OAuth scopes alone provide.

## How It Works

1. The IdP issues a token with claims (e.g., `roles`, `groups`, or custom claims)
2. The MCP server maps those claims to internal roles
3. Internal roles determine which tools and operations are available

## Example Token-to-Role Mapping

Token claim:
```json
{
  "sub": "user-123",
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": ["mcp-admin", "data-reader"]
  }
}
```

MCP server role mapping:
```yaml
rbac:
  role_mappings:
    admin:
      token_claim: "realm_access.roles"
      claim_value: "mcp-admin"
      permissions: ["tools:*", "config:*"]
    reader:
      token_claim: "realm_access.roles"
      claim_value: "data-reader"
      permissions: ["tools:read", "resources:read"]
    default:
      permissions: ["tools:list"]
```

## Defense-in-Depth Value

| Layer | Control |
|---|---|
| **OAuth scopes** | What the token is authorized for (coarse-grained) |
| **RBAC roles** | What the user's role allows within the application (fine-grained) |
| **Tool-level checks** | What the specific tool permits for this role |

All three layers must agree for an operation to proceed.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define internal roles relevant to the MCP server (e.g., admin, operator, reader)
- [ ] Map IdP token claims (roles, groups, custom claims) to internal roles
- [ ] Enforce RBAC checks on every tool invocation alongside scope checks
- [ ] Default to the least-privileged role when no matching claim is found
- [ ] Log role-based authorization decisions (grants and denials)
- [ ] Document the role definitions and their permissions
- [ ] Regularly review and audit role assignments
