# Roots Support for MCP Servers

## Security Requirement

MCP servers MUST support the roots directive and respect root boundaries during all operations. The roots directive defines the allowed filesystem boundaries within which the MCP server can operate.

## What Roots Provide

The roots mechanism allows MCP clients to declare which directories or resources the server is authorized to access. The server must:

- Accept the roots declaration from the client
- Constrain all operations to within the declared roots
- Reject any operation that would access resources outside the declared roots
- Never traverse above or outside root boundaries (no path traversal)

## Boundary Enforcement

```
Declared root: /home/user/project

Allowed:
  /home/user/project/src/main.py       ✓ (within root)
  /home/user/project/docs/readme.md    ✓ (within root)

Blocked:
  /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa               ✗ (outside root)
  /home/user/project/../.ssh/id_rsa    ✗ (traversal outside root)
  /etc/passwd                           ✗ (outside root)
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement support for the MCP roots directive
- [ ] Accept and store root declarations from clients
- [ ] Canonicalize all file paths before checking root boundaries (resolve symlinks, `..`, etc.)
- [ ] Reject operations targeting resources outside declared roots
- [ ] Prevent symlink-based escapes from root boundaries
- [ ] Default to no filesystem access if no roots are declared
- [ ] Log root boundary violations as security events
