# No Credential Forwarding in MCP Servers

## Security Requirement

MCP servers MUST NOT forward any credentials or authentication tokens received from users to downstream tools or third-party APIs. This is explicitly forbidden by the MCP specification and has a high security impact.

## Risks of Credential Forwarding

- **Token leakage**: User tokens exposed to third-party services
- **Confused deputy attacks**: Third-party services may use the user's token to access resources beyond what the MCP server intended
- **Excessive privilege**: Downstream tools receive user-level access when they only need scoped tool-level access
- **Audit trail corruption**: Actions performed by tools are attributed to the user instead of the MCP server

## Required Approach

Instead of forwarding user tokens, MCP servers MUST obtain separate credentials for downstream services through one of:

1. **OAuth client flows**: MCP server acts as an OAuth client and initiates its own OAuth flow to obtain tokens for third-party APIs
2. **Pre-registered service accounts**: Use API keys or service accounts registered specifically for the MCP server
3. **Token Exchange** (preferred): See the `token-exchange-for-tools` skill for the recommended approach

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Audit all outbound requests from the MCP server to external services
- [ ] Verify no user tokens are included in any outbound request headers, query parameters, or bodies
- [ ] Implement separate credential management for each downstream API
- [ ] Add automated tests that verify user tokens are never forwarded
- [ ] Log outbound requests (excluding sensitive headers) for security audit

## Anti-Pattern

```
# FORBIDDEN - never do this
def call_external_tool(user_token, tool_url, params):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_token}"}  # WRONG
    return requests.post(tool_url, headers=headers, json=params)
```

## Correct Pattern

```
# CORRECT - use MCP server's own credentials
def call_external_tool(tool_url, params):
    server_token = get_server_credential_for(tool_url)
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {server_token}"}
    return requests.post(tool_url, headers=headers, json=params)
```
