# Input/Output Sanitization for MCP Servers

## Security Requirement

MCP servers MUST treat all inputs as untrusted, including:

- User-provided parameters
- Prompt-driven parameters (values determined by the LLM)
- Descriptions and outputs from other tools
- Any data that flows through the MCP protocol

## Input Sanitization

| Input Source | Risk | Sanitization |
|---|---|---|
| **User parameters** | Injection, path traversal, XSS | Validate type, length, format; reject unexpected values |
| **LLM-generated parameters** | Prompt injection artifacts, malformed data | Same validation as user input; never trust LLM output implicitly |
| **Tool outputs used as inputs** | Poisoned tool chains, injection propagation | Validate before passing to next tool; treat as untrusted |
| **File paths** | Path traversal, symlink attacks | Canonicalize and validate against allowed directories |

## Output Sanitization

Tool outputs returned to clients or passed to other tools must also be sanitized:

- Strip or escape content that could be interpreted as code or commands
- Validate output format matches the expected schema
- Truncate excessively large outputs to prevent resource exhaustion
- Scrub sensitive data from outputs before returning to clients

## Key Principle

Never assume any input is safe because it came from "inside" the system. LLM-generated content and inter-tool communication are just as untrusted as external user input.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Validate all input parameters (type, length, format, allowed values)
- [ ] Treat LLM-generated parameters as untrusted input
- [ ] Treat outputs from other tools as untrusted input
- [ ] Implement path traversal prevention for any file path parameters
- [ ] Sanitize outputs before returning to clients
- [ ] Validate output format against expected schemas
- [ ] Truncate excessively large outputs
- [ ] Log sanitization actions (blocked or modified inputs) for security monitoring
